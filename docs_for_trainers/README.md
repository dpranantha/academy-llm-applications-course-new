# Docs for trainers
This folder contains documentation for trainers.
Here you find information on how to set up the training infrastructure, how to prepare for the training and several how-to guides.

## General TODOs before training
- [ ] I have created a new repo specifically for this training using this repo as a template ([how to](how-to-setup-new-repo-and-code-spaces.md)).
- [ ] I added all the neccessary GitHub CodeSpaces secrets ([how to](how-to-set-github-codespace-secrets.md))
- [ ] I have validated all the solutions notebooks run without errors using the GitHub CodeSpaces environment variables to ensure that the infrastructure is set up correctly.
- [ ] I have duplicated my own version of the Miro board to use in the training.
    - To do this, first request to join the `GoDataDriven Academy` team, by clicking the plus sign on the left-hand side of the [Miro homepage](https://miro.com/app/dashboard/).
    - Once you are a member, head to the [Miro board template](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNABD2U8=/), click on the name of the board in the top-left corner and create a duplicate with a different name.
    - Check that anyone with a link to the board by clicking `share` in the top-right corner of the new board.
- [ ] I have obtained the GitHub handle of the participants. If you don't already have them, ask for them in your introductory email.
- [ ] I have sent out a Teams/Zoom link to the participants if they are attending online.
- [ ] 1 or 2 days before the start of the training, I have added the participants to the repo as collaborators with write access.
    - To do this, go to the `godatadriven/academy-llm-applications-<training_name>` repoo and click the `settings` icon in the top-right corner.
    - Navigate to `Access` > `Collaborators and Teams`.
    - Under `Manage Access`, click `Add people`, enter the GitHub handle and select `write` access.
