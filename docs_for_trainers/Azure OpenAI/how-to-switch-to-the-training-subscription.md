# How to switch to the training subscription
We use a separate subscription for the training to prevent accidental data leaks to participants.
This subscription is called `Xebia Data` and is different from the default `Xebia` subscription.

You can do this as follows:
1. Click on your profile in the top right corner
2. Click on `Switch directory`
3. Click on the `Switch` button behind the directory with the name `Xebia Data`.

<mark>If you don't see the option for `Xebia Data` contact `james.hayward@xebia.com`. If you are in the company since before March 2023, you should have also received an email, inviting you to this Xebia Data Azure environment.
