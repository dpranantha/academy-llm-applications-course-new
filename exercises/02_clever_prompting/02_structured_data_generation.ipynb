    "## Introduction to Pydantic\n",
    "Before we dive into the exercise, let's first look at [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/). Pydantic is a library that allows you to create structured data models in Python. These models can be used to validate if data is correct and to parse raw data into a structured model. Pydantic is used in many Python libraries, including FastAPI and Typer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating a Pydantic model is very similar to the syntax for creating a dataclass. You create a Pydantic model as follows:\n",
    "- Create a class that inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel`.\n",
    "- Add fields to the class. Each field is a class attribute with a type annotation. Pydantic supports all Python types. For example, `int`, `str`, `bool`, `float`, `datetime.datetime`, etc. Pydantic also supports more advanced types such as `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, and even union type using the `|` operator. For example, `int | None` means that the field can be either an integer or `None`.\n"
