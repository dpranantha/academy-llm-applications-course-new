    "## Introduction to Pydantic\n",
    "Before we dive into the exercise, let's first look at [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/). Pydantic is a library that allows you to create structured data models in Python. These models can be used to validate if data is correct and to parse raw data into a structured model. Pydantic is used in many Python libraries, including FastAPI and Typer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax for creating a Pydantic model is very similar to the syntax for creating a dataclass. You create a Pydantic model as follows:\n",
    "- Create a class that inherits from `pydantic.BaseModel`.\n",
    "- Add fields to the class. Each field is a class attribute with a type annotation. Pydantic supports all Python types. For example, `int`, `str`, `bool`, `float`, `datetime.datetime`, etc. Pydantic also supports more advanced types such as `typing.List`, `typing.Dict`, and even union type using the `|` operator. For example, `int | None` means that the field can be either an integer or `None`.\n"

    "\n",
    "In the cell below, we have already created a function that extracts information from a description using the LLM. Notice that we have also specified that the model ouput should be [JSON](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/json-mode?tabs=python#json-mode-support). However, please note that JSON mode does not guarantee the output matches any specific schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is as follows:\n",
    "1. Write the prompt that tells the LLM what kind of JSON we want to generate. You can use the `HouseFeatures.model_json_schema()` method to generate the JSON schema.\n",
    "2. Parse the response from the LLM into a `HouseFeatures` model using the `HouseFeatures.model_validate_json` method.\n",
    "3. Run the cell and check if all tests pass. If not, try to improve the system prompt."
