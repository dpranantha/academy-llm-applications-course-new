    "## Introduction to LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous chapter, we explored how to interact directly with language models, like OpenAI's GPT or Google's Gemini (Vertex AI). While these APIs are powerful, working with them directly can become repetitive and cloud-specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain is a Python-based framework that simplifies the use of language models, providing a cloud-agnostic interface for interacting with providers like Google Vertex AI and (Azure) OpenAI. With LangChain, you can focus on what you want the model to do, not how to interact with different APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Use LangChain?**\n",
    "- Cloud-Agnostic: Switch between providers (e.g., OpenAI, Azure, Google) with minimal changes to your code.\n",
    "- Simplified Usage: LangChain abstracts away API-specific details, letting you use models in a more consistent and straightforward way.\n",
    "- Scalability: As your projects grow, LangChain makes it easier to manage interactions with models.\n"
