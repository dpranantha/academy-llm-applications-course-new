# Hackathon
During this training, you learned many different concepts and techniques.

We covered topics such as tokenization, embeddings, text generation, prompting, vector databases, retrieval augmented generation, and much more.

Now, it is time to put them all together and build something cool!

What you build is up to you.

## What is provided
We have set up a StreamLit template [main.py](./main.py) for you that you can run with the following command:

```bash
poetry run invoke hackathon
```

This will start the application.
However, it does not do anything yet.
It is up to you to make it do something cool!

## Inspiration
The white page syndrome is real and can be quite overwhelming!

To help you get started, we have listed some ideas below.
Feel free to use one of these ideas or develop your own idea.
The most important thing is that you have fun and creatively combine the different concepts you learned during the training.

- Build a retrieval augmented generation chatbot that works on your own data. For example, KnowledgeGPT [demo](https://knowledgegpt.streamlit.app/) and [code](https://github.com/mmz-001/knowledge_gpt).
- Build a dungeon and dragons game where an LLM application is the dungeon master. For example, [example](https://github.com/harmony-al/DNDwithGPT/tree/main).
- Build a search engine for your own notes.
- SEO Article Writer LLM application
- Write critic LLM application
- Personal Productivity Coach LLM application
- Grammar Checker LLM application
- Code Reviewer LLM application
- Code translator LLM application (e.g. Python to JavaScript)
- etc.
