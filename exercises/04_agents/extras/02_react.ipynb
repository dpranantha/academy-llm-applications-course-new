    "# Exercise 2: ReAct\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you built an agent that was able to complete tasks, which LLMs would normally struggle with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent was able to complete these tasks because additional tools were provided to the LLM. But crucially, it was able to determine when these tools were needed autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for the agent to produce a satisfactory result, we needed to write a long system prompt and be very explicit about what we wanted from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will learn how to create agents using the ReAct framework ([Wei *et al.*, 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)): an effective paradigm for prompt writing, which has been shown to outperform several benchmarks on language and decision-making tasks and can help to avoid issues of hallucination and error propagation. The improved human interpretability can also help engender trust in the model."
