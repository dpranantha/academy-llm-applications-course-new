# LLM applications

Hi! üëãüèª

This repository contains the exercises and material we will cover during the "LLM applications" training.

Since you're reading this, it means you've successfully gained access to this repo üéâ.

Please run through the **set-up** instructions _before_ the start of the training. If you encounter problems, please let your trainer know so that they can be dealt with before your first session.

## Codespace set-up

If you have a local Python installation, and you can set up Jupyter and Poetry, you will be able to follow the training using your own setup and the editor of your choice.

Alternatively, we provide a devcontainer that spins up an environment that you can use within VS Code with everything ready for the training. The steps to set this up are:

1. ‚úÖ Access the repository
2. Open or create a codespace on the `main` branch:

</p>
3. [Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview) allow you to work on a repository on a computer other than your own, saving you from the trouble of setting everything up yourself. After creating your codespace succesfully, you should see a VS Code interface in your browser:

</p>
4.  <details><summary>Optional step to access the codespace in your locally installed VS Code Desktop</summary> Open the command palette in VS Code you have opened in your browser. To open the command palette, on Mac the shortcut is `‚åò+SHIFT+P`, on Windows and Linux it is `Ctrl+Shift+P`. From the command palette, select "Codespaces: Open in VS Code Desktop", and follow the steps to open VS Code locally.

    </p>
    </details>
5. You should now have access to the code, in your personal codespace (either in the browser or in your locally installed VS Code Desktop).

</p>

To make sure everything is setup correctly you can:
- Inspect the bottom left corner, which should say "Codespaces" (may be located elsewhere in the Windows version)
- Open a terminal in VS Code and run `python -V`, which should return a Python version >= 3.9.
- Run `poetry -V`, which should return any version of Poetry.

6. When prompted in the notebooks, select the `.venv` Python:

</p>

7. That's it! You should be all setup now. Remember to delete the codespace when you have finished to save your account Usage/Storage hours.

### Google Cloud Authentication

*This step is only necessary if you are following the GCP version of this training.*

<details>
<summary>Authenticating Google Cloud</summary>

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. In the search bar at the top, search for the project ID used for this training. Your trainer will confirm what this is, but it probably starts with `academy-llm-applications-*`!
3. In your Codespace terminal, run `gcloud auth login` and log in to your Google account.
4. In the same terminal, run `gcloud auth application-default login` and log in to your Google account.
5. Set the project ID by running `gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>` in the terminal, replacing `<PROJECT_ID>` with the project ID from step 2.
6. Set the quota project by running `gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <PROJECT_ID>` in the terminal, again replacing `<PROJECT_ID>` with the project ID from step 2.

## Slides
The slides for this course can be found [here](https://xebiagroup.sharepoint.com/:f:/r/sites/Training/Gedeelde%20documenten/2.%20Training%20Material/1.%20Master%20Slides/Building%20LLM%20Applications?csf=1&web=1&e=siZQh3).

## Exercises
Each part of the training consists of a set of exercises.
The exercises are located in the `exercises` folder and the solutions are located in the `solutions` folder.
Each part starts with notebook-based exercises, followed by a more complex application.
The notebook-based exercises are meant to get you familiar with the concepts, while the application exercises are meant to test knowledge get you ready for larger projects.

## Applications

You will use [streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) to build the apps in the assignments. In case you are unfamiliar with this framework we have provided a [Streamlit tutorial](./streamlit).

Please check the documentation on [port forwarding](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-a-codespace/forwarding-ports-in-your-codespace#) if you have trouble opening your streamlit application in a Codespace.

## Hackathon
This is an open-ended exercise where you can apply the concepts you've learned in the training.
You find the instructions in the [exercises/42_hackathon/readme.md](./exercises/42_hackathon/README.md).

## Instructions for the training developer
### Preparing the training
All the needed preparing for the training can be found in the [docs_for_trainers](docs_for_trainers/READMD.md) folder.
Make sure you read this before you start the training.

### Developing exercises
The exercises are generated automatically.
Please develop and make changes only in the solutions folder.
Then run the following command to generate the exercises:

```bash
poetry run invoke generate-exercises
```

This will automatically generate the exercises and copy them to the `exercises` folder.
It also automatically removes all the code between the `# START CODE HERE` and `# END CODE HERE` comments in the notebooks and python files.

If you use pre-commit, this will be run automatically before each commit.
So you don't have to worry about it.
You can add the pre-commit hook by running the following command:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

If you don't use pre-commit, the CI will fail if you forget to run this command.
